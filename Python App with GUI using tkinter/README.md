# Learning GUI Using Tkinter from freecodecamp.org
##  Sequence of functions learned
### Set root = Tk()
* Label,  takes two parameters, root and text
* pack(), shoves label into window
* mainloop(), loops through the window

### pack() didn't give too much control
* grid(), takes 2 parameters, row and column and are relative
* can write Label().grid()
* Button(), takes parameters, root, text, state, padx, pady
* function on click, when calling function don't forget to not put the parenthesis -> (command = myClick) is correct not myClick()
* Entry(), takes parameters, root,width , height, bg, fg, borderwidth
* get() takes whatever you Enter
* insert(), puts default text in entry bpx
### Building a simple calculator app
